Simulation of an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma between an experimentalist and an agent. The experimentalist interacts with the agent over multiple rounds, aiming to infer the agent’s strategy based on their decisions. The agent’s strategy can vary (e.g., always cooperate, always defect, tit-for-tat, or random, etc.), and the experimentalist’s goal is to learn the underlying behavior through repeated interactions.
